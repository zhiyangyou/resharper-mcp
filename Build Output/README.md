# ReSharper MCP Server

**Version:** `0.11.0`


An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that runs inside the ReSharper/Rider backend process, exposing code intelligence features to AI assistants via HTTP.

Supports C#, F#, VB, and any language with a ReSharper PSI implementation.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `find_usages` | Find all references to a symbol |
| `get_symbol_info` | Detailed symbol info: kind, type, params, docs, base types, members |
| `find_implementations` | Find implementations of interfaces/abstract classes and overrides |
| `get_file_errors` | Get compile errors and unresolved references |
| `search_symbol` | Search symbols by name (substring match) across the solution |
| `go_to_definition` | Navigate to a symbol's declaration with source text |
| `get_solution_structure` | List projects, target frameworks, and project references |
| `browse_namespace` | Browse namespace hierarchy: child namespaces and types |
| `list_symbols_in_file` | List all declarations in a file |
| `list_solutions` | List all open solutions across Rider instances, each with a stable `id` (full .sln path) |
| `fix_usings` | Fix missing using directives in C# files |
| `format_file` | Format, clean up, or apply code style to a file |
| `flow` | Describe control flow of a method or type: execution steps, branches, loops, error paths, inlined call targets |
| `get_symbol_source` | Get the full declaration source code of a symbol (not just a snippet) |
| `get_call_hierarchy` | Build an incoming (callers) or outgoing (callees) call hierarchy tree for a method |
| `get_type_hierarchy` | Get the inheritance hierarchy of a type: supertypes (base/interfaces) or subtypes |
| `get_diagnostics` | Run daemon inspections on a file; reports severity, inspection id, message, location, and quick-fix availability |
| `list_quick_fixes` | List the ReSharper quick-fixes (bulb actions) available at a position |
| `complete_at` | Get code completion suggestions at a caret position |

Write tools (modify source — require a write lock):

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rename_symbol` | Semantic, solution-wide rename of a symbol and all its references (supports `dryRun`) |
| `generate_members` | Generate members on a type (constructors, overrides, equality members, etc.) |
| `apply_quick_fix` | Apply a ReSharper quick-fix (bulb action) at a position |
| `apply_suggestions` | Apply inspection quick-fixes file-wide by inspection id (e.g. convert explicit constructor → primary constructor); position-free, `dryRun`/`all` supported |

### Symbol resolution

Tools that operate on a symbol accept two modes:
- **By position** — `filePath` + `line` + `column` (1-based)
- **By name** — `symbolName` (e.g. `"MyClass"`, `"Namespace.MyClass"`, `"MyClass.MyMethod"`)

An optional `kind` filter (`"type"`, `"method"`, `"property"`, `"field"`, `"event"`) helps disambiguate. When multiple symbols match, tools return an ambiguity error listing all candidates with their qualified names, kinds, and locations.

### Batch mode

Most tools support batch mode — processing multiple inputs in a single call. This reduces round-trips when querying several symbols or files at once:

- **Symbol-based tools** (`find_usages`, `get_symbol_info`, `find_implementations`, `go_to_definition`) accept a `symbols` array of `{symbolName, kind, filePath, line, column}` objects.
- **File-based tools** (`get_file_errors`, `list_symbols_in_file`, `fix_usings`, `format_file`) accept a `filePaths` array of strings.
- **`search_symbol`** accepts a `queries` array of strings.
- **`browse_namespace`** accepts a `namespaceNames` array of strings.

Results are concatenated with `=== [N/total] label ===` separators. Shared options (e.g. `maxResults`, `kinds`, `mode`) apply to all items in the batch. Original single-input parameters remain for backward compatibility.

## Installation

### From JetBrains Marketplace

Install the plugin from Rider: **Settings → Plugins → Marketplace** → search for "MCP Server for Code Intelligence".

### From source

```bash
./install-rider.sh
# Restart Rider
```

The script builds the plugin and copies it to your local Rider plugin directory.

## MCP client configuration

Add to your MCP client config (e.g. Claude Code `settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "resharper": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:23741/"
    }
  }
}
```

The server starts automatically when you open a solution in Rider.

Set `RESHARPER_MCP_PORT` environment variable to override the default port.

## Building

```bash
# Build the .NET backend
dotnet build src/ReSharperMcp/ReSharperMcp.csproj -c Release

# Build a distributable plugin ZIP
./build-plugin.sh
```

## Architecture

- Runs as a ReSharper `SolutionComponent` (activated when a solution opens, stopped when it closes)
- Hosts an HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:23741` implementing MCP over JSON-RPC 2.0
- Uses ReSharper's PSI (Program Structure Interface) APIs for code analysis
- Two-part Rider plugin: minimal JVM JAR (plugin descriptor) + .NET backend DLL
- Targets `net472` (required by the ReSharper host process)
